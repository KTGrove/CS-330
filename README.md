# CS-330
Render of a 3D scene
# How do I approach designing software?
In working on this project I first began my design process by looking at objects around me that I would find in my personal environment.
I then arranged some of those items in a way that coudl be used for a logo of some sort, thinking, if I'm making promotional material for a 
business, it needs to have some sort of theme and cohesion. From there I started with a 2D drawing of the objects to give myself a better idea
of which objects would be best to use in creating the overall scene. Replicating 2D objects in a 3D environment has given me a better understanding 
of how complex objects are built in large environments like video games or animated movies. I found this project quite enjoyable as it allowed
me to be creative with my scene and its objects. If I continue work like this in the future I'll likely use a similar planning method to give
myself a greta understanding of what shapes and textrues I need for my scene. Overall, my design skills have expanded immensely considering prior 
to this project I did not have the ability to render 3D objects in an OpenGL C++ environment. 
# How do I approach developing programs?
New development strategies I've used within this project is more detailed commenting. For each new thing that I added I ensured that I knew
what object it was related to so I could keep track of the development of each object individually. This applied to textures, meshes, and light
sources. Iteration was a large factor in this project as I used the same exact code for each mesh and altered it where necessary. I did the same
for meshes, calling functions to apply meshes, and the lighting for the scene. Each item of code was just altered in the appropriate manner
to create the item needed for the scene. My approach to code development has evolved in that I now have a better understanding of how recyclable
my code can be making it easier to develop major projects in the future. 
# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
If I were to pursue a degree in graphical development of a sort this would give me a great basis for those development environments and the type of
code and functions typically required within them. However, I still am unsure of what path I will take in the future once I have completed my degree 
program and have decided to continue with an education in basic software engineering to broaden the scope of which I can perform within. I do hope
that I have another chance in the future to utilize these skills whether for work or a project of my own.
